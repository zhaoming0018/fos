							    <strong>Photoelectric Information Processing and Measurement Techniques</strong><br/>　　It contains the techniques about optical sensor, mechatronics with computer control and image processing 
							and covers many theories about physical model, numerical simulation, optical metrology 
							and optical information processing an so on. It is a hot interdisciplinary research topic, 
							and it has a high speed of technological updating and has united theories and applications in equal measure. 
							It can be applied to everything from microscopic to macroscopic, and it has high academic value 
							and huge beneficial effects in social applied economics especially in today’s information time. 
							The main characteristics embodied in the study are: optical detection theory and application in biological cells, 
							optical anomalous transmission and application.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong>Laser-matter Interaction Physics </strong><br/>　　Laser ultrasonic is an emerging interdisciplinary subject which uses laser to generate and detect ultrasonic, 
							researching on the transmission of ultrasonic and non-destructive evaluation on material behaviors. 
							Compared with traditional technique of piezoelectric transducer, the main advantage of Laser Ultrasonic 
							is non-contacted detecting. It is the most promising technique of non-contacted detecting because it can be used 
							to detect the characteristics of various complex topographies as it eliminates the influences of couplant 
							in technique of piezoelectric transducer and it is also a detecting technique of wideband meanwhile it can use 
							the light-wavelength as the metric to accurately measure the shift of ultrasonic. 
							The laser ultrasonic technique can be used not only to do online non-contacted detecting on the mechanical 
							characteristics of material but also to do research on fields of biology and medicine. 
							It can be studied in the characteristics of material in nanometer scale if combined with scanning probe microscopy.
							</p>
							<p>
							    　　At present, this subject is mainly to consider the characteristics of material’s thermal parameter 
							with temperature changes, using Finite Element Method to numerically simulate the transient temperature field which 
							is excited by laser in the material, building the Finite Element Model of ultrasonic’s generation and 
							transmission under the Thermoelastic system. It analyses the propagation characteristics of ultrasonic’s surface 
							waviness received by far field and near field and discusses the relations between input parameters of laser and 
							the characteristics of ultrasonic generated by laser, building the theoretical model of Laser Ultrasonic Detecting 
							of material’s characteristics under the Thermoelastic condition and first inverting the Neural Network Approach 
							to get the physical and geometric parameters of material. It&#39;s very important to measure the Interface 
							Bonding Strength (tensile strength) in the research of interface science, but how to measure the interface 
							tensile strength directly and quantitatively is still a question to scientists all over the world. 
							It&#39;s the first time to change the style of laser loading to change the strain rate and measure the hard 
							film&#39;s bonding strength under dynamic and static state respectively. 
							We not only get the correct measurements of adhesion but also evaluate comprehensive mechanical properties 
							of interface more scientifically.
